Code has been modularized and optimized to run as individual test classes
  - It can be improved in such a way that all the tests can be added to a TestNG Suite file
  - By adding a Suite File, we can avoid calling the driver.get() method in each class since we are calling the same web page for all the tests
    Ex: Include @BeforeSuite annotation in TestBase class and add driver.get("url")
  - Rather than calling sleeps after each action, it would be efficient if we wait on a condition before each action
  - Actions like validating "searchSummaryDisplayed" could be moved to a common place
  - Avoid using absolute XPaths (2 places)
